# Algorithms

This repo implements the algorithms found in <i> "Introduction To Algorithms" </i> in Elixir. 

<b> Why Elixir? </b> Elixir is a functional programming language which, as the paradigm suggests, values immutability and values 'pure' functions with no side effects. 

<b> So what? </b> Well, <i> "Intro To Algorithms" </i> provides you with the pseudo code to easily replicate in languages in Python, Java, JavaScript - you name it! 

However, imho copying and pasting pseudo code across isn't as effective as understanding the pseudo code first and then <i> "translating" </i> it into a different "form" of code. 

And that's where Elixir comes in. Because of its core functional background the pseudo code does not directly translate over, you have to sit down - <b> understand </b> the problem inside and out and then work out a solution in Elixir. 

It's been good fun so far and I would highly recommend it!

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `algorithms` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:algorithms, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
